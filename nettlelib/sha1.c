/* Here's the first paragraph of Peter Gutmann's posting,
 * <30ajo5$oe8@ccu2.auckland.ac.nz>: 
 *
 * The following is my SHA (FIPS 180) code updated to allow use of the "fixed"
 * SHA, thanks to Jim Gillogly and an anonymous contributor for the information on
 * what's changed in the new version.  The fix is a simple change which involves
 * adding a single rotate in the initial expansion function.  It is unknown
 * whether this is an optimal solution to the problem which was discovered in the
 * SHA or whether it's simply a bandaid which fixes the problem with a minimum of
 * effort (for example the reengineering of a great many Capstone chips).
